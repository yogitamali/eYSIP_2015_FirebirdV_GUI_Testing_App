# eYSIP_2015_Auto_Tagging_Selection_Test
Part 1: The aim of part 1 of the project is to use the data generated during the online selection test for e-YRC 2015 to determine the accuracy of the manual difficulty tagging process. Each question is manually assigned a difficulty and the project will aim to find the accuracy and also suggest auto corrections based on the performance of students towards the questions and its assigned difficulty. Part 2: Given the profile of a student taking the test, create a Machine Learning model to deduce its performance in the selection test based on the current year's data.
